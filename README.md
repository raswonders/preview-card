## My process

I took this as opportunity to practice mobile-first workflow. It felt more straight forward. I knew which design to start with and build from there.

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [TS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typescript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I've positioned content within <img> with object-fit & object-position not through background positioning. First time i used these, hit a little road block with it but with help of community i've figured it out. 

### Continued development

Tailwind feels more natural I still need to look up many class names though. I'm sure doing more ui work will help here.
